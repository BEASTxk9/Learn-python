# 1. Write a script that adds 15 and 30 and divides the sum by 2. Print out the answer.

# x = 15;
# y = 30;
# z = 2;

# print("x + y / z =", (x + y) / z);                               # run `cd exercises` then `py exercise1.py`
# print(f"x + y / z = {(x + y) / z}");                             # run `cd exercises` then `py exercise1.py`
# print("15 + 30 / 2 =", (15 + 30) / 2);                           # run `cd exercises` then `py exercise1.py`




# 2. Initialize two variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder.

# a = 12;
# b = 18;

# print(f"a + b = {a + b}");
# print(f"a * b = {a * b}");
# print(f"a / b = {a / b}");
# print(f"a % b = {a % b}");




# 3. Create a variable called name and store your name in it as a string.

# name = "Shane";
# print(f"My name is {name}."); 




# 4. Create three variables in one line and assign each one a different food item.

# orange, apple, grape = "orange", "apple", "grape";
# print(f"A fruit basket with {orange}'s, {apple}'s & {grape}'s");




# 5. Print out "Hello" ten times using arithmetic operators.

# str = "Hello ";
# print(str * 10);




# 6. Set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment

# name, age = "Shane", 20;
# print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.");




# 7. Create two strings and then create a third variable combining both of the two original strings.

# str1 = "Shane";
# str2 = "Stevens";
# string = str1 +" "+ str2;

# print(f"My full name is {string}.");




# 8. Create a string and print the fourth letter of the word.

# array_kinda_sorta = "12345";
# print(array_kinda_sorta[4]);




# 9. Create a string and print the letters from index 0 to 5.

# greetings = "Hello World!";
# print(greetings[0:5]);




# 10. Create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end.

# farwell = "Goodbye World!";
# print(farwell[1:]);
